- Only compile mmtest if glib is installed
	Or maybe just get rid of mmtest.c

- Split out ring code into qxl_ring.c

Question:

- What is the "vram" PCI range used for? 

  As I read the Windows driver, it can be mapped with the ioctl
  VIDEO_MAP_VIDEO_MEMORY. In driver.c it is mapped as pdev->fb, but
  it is then never used for anything as far as I can tell.

  Does Windows itself use that ioctl, and if so, for what. The area
  is only 32K in size so it can't really be used for any realistic
  bitmaps.

Done:

- Get rid of qxl_mem.h header; just use qxl.h
